If an apk is set as android:sharedUserId="android.uid.system" in the AndroidManifest.xml, it must be signed with platform key and then it is usable.

1. Get signapk.jar in //prebuilts/sdk/tools/lib/
2. test-key: in //build/target/product/security/
3. release-key: in //vander/nvidia/security/cardhu/
   The key should have password according to your project
4. zipalign can align apk to obtain better efficiency
`zipalign.exe -f 4 input.apk output.apk`

`java -jar signapk.jar platform.x509.pem platform.pk8 input.apk output.apk`
